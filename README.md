# landing_page

The landing_page is my interpretation of The Odin Projects ‘landing_page’ exercise. This exercise aims to test flexbox skills and the ability to replicate templates - this is how I treated this exercise. 

This is the second version of the HTML and CSS after having to rethink how flexbox actually worked and I attempted to strip away unnecessary code wherever possible from the 1st draft. Mostly, I removed unnecessary classes and targeted elements and subclasses where appropriate. 

As the exercise states, DO NOT use this code as a best practice example as this was my first/ second attempt using flexbox. 

Best, 

Anthony
